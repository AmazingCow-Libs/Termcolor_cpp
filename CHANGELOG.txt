v0.1.0 [Nov 27 2015]
    Finish the basic implementation.

v0.1.1 [Jan 21 2016]
    Update the license headers.
    Change the license to GPLv3.

v0.2.0 [Mar 22 2016]
    Add a way to control if the coloring will be put on stream or not.
    The default is ColorMode::OnlyIfTerminal so it will not impact the older
    code and will do the "right" thing from now.
